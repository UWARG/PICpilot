 * Function: float controlSignalHeading(float setpoint, float output, float time)
 *
 * Preconditions: None.
 *
 * Overview: This function is responsible for the heading of the plane. It
 * contains the equations that model a PID control system. It calculates the
 * proportional, integral, and derivative terms of the control signal. The setpoint (target value
 * required by the system) and the output (current state of the system) are both
 * inputs to this function in terms of angles (deg) ranging from 0 to 359 degrees (as per compass bearings).
 *
 * Input:   float setpoint -> The target value that is required by the system.
 *              (Input from the controller or path manager)
 *          float output -> The acutal value of the system (Data from the GPS)
 *          float time -> The current time as of the last system cycle.
 *
 * Output:  float -> An integer value representing the output of the system
 *              (heading rate). This value is in degrees per second.
