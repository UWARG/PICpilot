 * @description This module abstracts the PWM input and output functionalities of the
 * chip. It combines the InputCompare and OutputCompare module, and provides functions
 * for scaling/calibrating PWM values, reading scaled PWM values, and setting scaled PWM values
 * for any of the 8 available PWM channels on the chip.
 * 
 * Note that this is the module that scales the PWM inputs from the RC controller
 * range to the -1024 to 1024 range, as well as scales the outputs in the opposite manner.
 * 
 * Also note that channel 7 input by default is set as the UHF keep alive channel,
 * and is tracked to for detecting UHF loss
