//Defines the usage of this chip. It may be one or multiple of the following roles:
//  Path Manager - Communicates with the GPS in order to provide a constant
//                  heading for the aircraft to follow.
//  Attitude Manager - Communicates with a IMU (kinematics sensor) in order to
//                      the desires Pitch, Roll, Yaw on the aircraft.
//  Communication Manager - Provides network communication (uplink/downlink) between the aircraft and
//                          the ground station (or any other data link).
